Read        n               ; Read an integer value from input and store it in n
LoadM       n               ; Load the value of n into the accumulator
ModI        2               ; Calculate the remainder of the accumulator divided by 2
Store       remainder        ; Store the result (remainder) in the variable 'remainder'
Write       remainder        ; Output the value of 'remainder' to the screen
Halt        stop            ; Stop the execution of the program
